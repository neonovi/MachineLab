Overiview: My project ended up being a small miniature version of my hobby. I really like to play a VR game called beat saber. My project ended up being a replica of a player slicing notes. This project consists of the following parts:
* body
* stand
* 4 servo motors
* 4 parts of notes
* 2 hands
* 2 stepper motors
* piezo buzzer
* arduino (with motorshield)

Before discussing the functionality, I'll talk about how the idea came to mind. 
Before coming up with this idea that I ended up with, I wanted to work on the clock mechanism (as an idea for the final project, since the prompt was a big clock used by the whole class). I made some rough sketches of my initial idea:

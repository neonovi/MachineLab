Overiview: My project ended up being a small miniature version of my hobby. 
Here is the to-do list for the project:
- [x] Come up with an idea
- [x] sketch it out
- [x] make it in fusion
- [x] apply functionality
- [x] submit everything to readme.md

I really like to play a VR game called beat saber. My project ended up being a replica of a player slicing notes. This project consists of the following parts:
* 1 body (laser cut)
* 1 base (laser cut)
* 4 servo motors
* 4 parts of notes (3d printed)
* 2 hands (laser cut)
* 2 stepper motors
* 1 piezo buzzer
* 1 arduino (with motorshield)

Before discussing the functionality, I'll talk about how the idea came to mind. 
Before coming up with this idea that I ended up with, I wanted to work on the clock mechanism (as an idea for the final project, since the prompt was a big clock used by the whole class). I made some rough sketches of my initial idea:

These are the possible topics to discuss our final project ideas:

During one of the classes we voted on a final project idea which became the hobby replica. 
I really was strugling to come up with a mechanism that involves my hobby. The previous day I was pleaying some VR games so I decided to tie that up to the project. 

I started constructing the prototype but it turned out to be awful, since my Fusion skills were not really good at the moment. 

Later on I came up with a michanism that will divide a note in two (make a view that its being sliced) and the added that to the fusion sketch. I really liked the idea and continued adding stuff like moving hands and swords. Later on Michael said that it would be great to mount the servos as they are supposed to be. So my final edits were grounding the servos to the base and since they were sticking out from the bottom, I added height to the stand, such taht the servos wont be touching the ground. I also changed the hand servos to stepper motors, because they look more natural on the body. They look like shoulders of the player (or could look like shoulder armor). Here is the picture of the final version:

Most of the project will be laser cut since acrylis is very lightweighted and can be colorful. The only two parts that are not laser cut are the servo mounts since all of the three dimensions are bigger than the acrylic we have. The main problem of the project was not knowing fusion well enough. Not knowing the possibilities didin't motivate to work on the project. After learning some cool techniches (like motion link and creating custom sketches not only in 2d) really boosted my motivation to work on the project. The project assembly is very straightforwarded. Most of it will be glued using acrylic glue. The parts that are not in the sketch but are required are: piezo buzzer and arduino.

Overiview: My project ended up being a small miniature version of my hobby. 
Here is the to-do list for the project:
- [x] Come up with an idea
- [x] sketch it out
- [x] make it in fusion
- [x] apply functionality
- [x] submit everything to readme.md

I really like to play a VR game called beat saber. My project ended up being a replica of a player slicing notes. This project consists of the following parts:
* body
* stand
* 4 servo motors
* 4 parts of notes
* 2 hands
* 2 stepper motors
* piezo buzzer
* arduino (with motorshield)

Before discussing the functionality, I'll talk about how the idea came to mind. 
Before coming up with this idea that I ended up with, I wanted to work on the clock mechanism (as an idea for the final project, since the prompt was a big clock used by the whole class). I made some rough sketches of my initial idea:

These are the possible topics to discuss our final project ideas:

During one of the classes we voted on a final project idea which became the hobby replica. 
I really was strugling to come up with a mechanism that involves my hobby. The previous day I was pleaying some VR games so I decided to tie that up to the project. 

I started constructing the prototype but it turned out to be awful, since my Fusion skills were not really good at the moment.
